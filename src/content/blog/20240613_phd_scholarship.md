After an oral examination and a credential's review I've won one of the two available Computer Science PhD scholarships at the University of Pisa.

I will start my PhD journey the 1st of November, 2024 at the [ItaliaNLP Lab](http://www.italianlp.it/) at the Computational Linguistic Institute of the Italian National Research Council in Pisa. 

My PhD Research Project revolves around the idea of better controlling generations of Large Language Models (LLMs), in particular:
- From a **Syntactic** point-of-view by using Controlled Text Generation techniques, focusing of **text simplification** tasks. 
- From a **Semantic** point-of-view by developing resources and technique to identify and possibly correcting LLM's hallucinations. 

The full text of my proposal can be found [here](/pdfs/research_proposal.pdf).
