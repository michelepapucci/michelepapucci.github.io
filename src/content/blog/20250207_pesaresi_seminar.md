Glad to announce that on the seventh of February I will present a seminar on Hallucination Detection and Prevention at the second appointment of the Mauriana Pesaresi Seminar Series. 
My talk, intitled "Toronto is the capital of Canada: Detecting and Preventing LLMs from Hallucinating" will briefly delve into the open research problem of Hallucination on LLMs and what needs to be done to stop this phenomenon. 

The Talk's Slides can be found [here](/pdfs/slide_pesaresi.pdf).
