Yesterday I came back from the [Learning over Time Spring School](https://sites.google.com/unisi.it/lot-spring-school/program-2025). It has been a fun and scientifically interesting PhD School. I really enjoyed two talks in particular, "*New avenues in Long-Sequence Processing without Attention*" by Prof. Orvieto and "*Toward the Post-dataset Eta. Embracing Data Streams*" from Prof. Efros.  
I have notes on both lectures (That need to be properly cleaned yet) [here](https://notes-vault.pages.dev/PhD/Conference-Notes/LoT-Spring-School-2024/25.03.25---New-avenues-in-Long-Sequence-Processing--without-Attention---Antonio-Orvieto) and [here](https://notes-vault.pages.dev/PhD/Conference-Notes/LoT-Spring-School-2024/25.03.25---Toward-the-Post-dataset-Eta.-Embracing-Data-Streams---Alexei-(Alyosha)-Efros).
