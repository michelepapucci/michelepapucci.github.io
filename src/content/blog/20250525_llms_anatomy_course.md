Tomorrow, 26th of May 2025, a course for the Engineering Department of the University of Pisa will start, and I am lucky to be part of it. Together with friend and colleague [Alessio Miaschi](https://alemiaschi.github.io/) from the ItaliaNLP Lab of the Computational Linguistics Institute of the CNR, we will hold a course about using Transformers. The calendar of the course is the following:
- 26th of May - Lecture 1: Introduction to NLP and Language Models;
- 30th of May - Lecture 2: Introduction to Transformers + Laboratory;
- 11th of June - Lecture 3: Transformer Pipeline + Laboratory;
- 13th of June - Lecture 4: Generative Models and their Uses + Laboratory;
- 16th of July - Lecture 5: Interpretability and Analysis of Transformers + Laboratory;
- 18th of July - Lecture 6: Interpretability and Explainability for Transformers + Laboratory;

The repository with slides and code it’s available on my GitHub and will be updated during the course!
