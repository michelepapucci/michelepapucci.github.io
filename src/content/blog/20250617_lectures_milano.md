Tomorrow I'll be in Milan, at the [Catholic University of the Sacred Heart](https://www.unicatt.it/en.html) for the 2025 edition of the [Lectures on Computational Linguistics](https://www.ai-lc.it/en/lectures-2/lectures-2025-ing/), organized by the [Italian Association for Computational Linguistics](https://www.ai-lc.it/en/) (AILC).   
I will present my poster on Controllable Text Generation for Style and Content (poster's pdf available [here](/pdfs/poster_lecture_milano.pdf)). I'll talk about my latest work, accepted at Findings of ACL 2025 (blog post about it [here](/blog/paper-accepted-at-findings-of-acl-2025), paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24523)), on using Reinforcement Learning to create LLM Agents capable of producing text that is undetectable by Machine Generated Text Detectors, and another work, currently under review, on a new Text Simplification Resource for Italian created automatically through the use of Controlled LLMs. 

See you there!
