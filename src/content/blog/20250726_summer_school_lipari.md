Last week I've been to the Eolie Archipelago, in the Isle of **Lipari** where I partecipated in this years' **Summer School on Computational Complex and Social System**. The focus was about E-Health: Models, Algorithms, Platforms and Ethics.  
We've heard wonderful talks, and we had a lot of good summer times around the archipelago. We've visited Vulcano, Salina, Panarea and Stromboli, had lots of swimming session from the Merenda Navigation boat. 
Truly an amazing experience.
