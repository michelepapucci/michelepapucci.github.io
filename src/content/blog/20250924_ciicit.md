This morning, at 09:00 (after being late out at the Social Dinner last evening) I presented my latest work, co-authored togheter with my supervisor Felice Dell'Orletta and a ItaliaNLP Lab collegue, Giulia Venturi, titled: "Generating and Evaluating Multi-Level Text Simplification: A Case Study on Italian" 

The work is about an investigation into the use of LLMs for creating large Multi-Level Sentence Simplification resources.
We found that LLMs can indeed be used as a source of synthetic data for this purpose, and we plan to create a large resource for Controlled Text Simplification using this technique in the near future. 

You can find the paper [here](https://clic2025.unica.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/81_main_long.pdf) (Pre-Proceedings, as soon as the Proceedings on ACL Anthology will be out, I'll update the link) and my presentation slides [here](/pdfs/clic-it-2025.pdf). 
Also, [here](https://github.com/michelepapucci/multilevel-text-simplification-italian) is the GitHub Repository with all the produced data.
