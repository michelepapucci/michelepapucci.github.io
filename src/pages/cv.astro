    I started my journey at a technical High School learning <b
      >Computer Science</b
    >. From there, I've always tried to both work and study to have a better
    prospective on realistic application of the subjects I've studied. I
    finished my Bachelor's and Master's in time while working full time jobs,
    and then decided to leave my last job to focus on my PhD. <br />
    I've worked mostly as a <b>Full-Stack Developer</b> during my Bachelor's years
    and then during my Master's I've moved onto Data Science job focusing on <b
      >Natural Language Processing</b>. <br/>

    I’ve worked on the development of Natural Language Processing tools based on both traditional
    and Deep Neural Network architecture served as API in a Business-to-Business setting. In
    particular, I’ve been directly responsible for the re-writing and upgrading of a NLP Pipeline from Python 2 to Python 3 (sentence splitter, tokenizer, PoS-Tagger, Dependecy Parser).
    I've developed efficient NLP tools based on the linguistic pipeline and contextual and non-contextual word-embeddings (NER, Sentiment and Topic Classifier, Readability Measurer). 
    Then, these services have been serviced through an web API interface for business-to-business applications.

      I've worked at a Project titled "2022/1698, Ottimizzazione di interfacce API a strumenti di analisi linguistica sviluppati
      dall’Italian Natural Language Processing Lab (ItaliaNLP Lab)" where I've worked on the creation of an end-to-end test suite, to validate the functionalities of a Linguistic Analysis service served through web API.
      Then, I developed a demo website showcasing the API functionalities and did a comparative study between the in-house Linguistic Analysis API and the state-of-the-art libraries available at that time.
